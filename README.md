# HuffmanCode
Huffman code implimentation in C++

You will need to create .txt files that will be read in. 
The .txt files will go into the same location as your project so that it can be read in.

There are two options when you are going to run the program:
Option 1: To read in the aforementioned files to the huffman code algorithm.
Option 2: The user will enter a string and that string will be ran through the huffman code algorithm.
Please note that for option 2, the encoded string will display as binary values and not the appropriate ASCII values that are expected.
